Here's where I keep all of the necessary files to run the dashboard.

It consists mainly of:

backend.py which handles all of the api calls, tweet parsing, data structures, dataframes, etc

st_styles.py which controls some of the layout and text of the streamlit page

dashboard.py which puts this all together and runs streamlit
